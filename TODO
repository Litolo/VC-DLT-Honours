immediate:
create verification (through smart contract? Need to discuss) [D]
implement revocation and suspension functionality -> do we check if the licence has already been revoked/suspended on the contract,
 or will this be left for the issuer to check off chain first? -> rn is checking in contract, emits 
 sequence of events for auditing and verifying that transactions execute in correct order (i.e. issue, 1 ... suspend, 2 ... revoke, 3)

future:
think about how to bind holder identity to credential [maybe done?]
how is verification done [D] -> via hashing the unencrypted data and sending it alongside the encrypted data
evaluation and optimisations
